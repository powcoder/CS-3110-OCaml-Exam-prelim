   Academic Integrity Statement

   I, the person named in the @author comment above, have fully reviewed the
   course academic integrity policies, and the instructions document for this
   exam.  I acknowledge that the minimum penalty for cheating on this exam
   is a score of -100%.  I acknowledge that no collaboration is permitted,
   nor is use of sites such as Chegg.

   If there are any violations I want to admit, I have documented them here,
   or I will send them by email to the professor:

   - none
